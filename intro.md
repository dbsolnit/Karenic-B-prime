## Karen Languages
Place in Tibeto-Burman and Sino-Tibetan.

Proto-Karen: two tones in smooth syllables, atonal checked syllables, plus a residual correspondence set called B' (B-prime). 

## Area spoken

## The Proposal
Karen tone B' is attested only with non-voiced initials.

I suggest that "Tone B'" items:

    Were characterized by a final obstruent that was not an oral stop.
    With voiced initials, merged completely with another tone (most likely B) prior to any tone split.

(2) explains the merger with checked syllables in the central languages—those that preserved no trace of final obstruents—and with non-checked syllables in the peripheral languages, which merged but preserved final obstruents.
