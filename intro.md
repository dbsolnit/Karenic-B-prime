# Introduction

Placeholder, to be filled in

## Karen Languages
Place in Tibeto-Burman and Sino-Tibetan.

Proto-Karen: tones A and B in smooth syllables, atonal checked syllables termed category D, plus a residual correspondence set called B' (B-prime). 

## Area spoken
Karen languages are spoken in an area straddling the Burma-Thailand border, as shown in this map (Karen areas in red and pink):

## The Proposal
Karen tone B-prime is attested only with non-voiced initials.

I suggest that "Tone B-prime" items:

- Were characterized by a final obstruent that was not an oral stop.
- With voiced initials, merged completely with another tone (most likely B) prior to any tone split.

This accounts for the way that the B-prime items merged:
- In the central languages, which preserved no trace of final obstruents, B-prime merged with the reflexes of checked syllables.
- In the peripheral languages, which preserved final obstruents (merged as glottal stop), B-prime merged with non-checked syllables.
