# The Proposal
## Peripheral Merger with A or B
Pa-O and Sgaw merge B-prime with A.

Pho merges B-prime with B.

Sgaw Tones \([Jones 1965](https://github.com/dbsolnit/Karenic-B-prime/blob/main/references.md#jones-1965)\)
| |A | B| B'| D|
--|--|--| --| --|
|High|45|53~|53&#660;| 33&#660;|
|Mid|45|53~|53&#660;| 33&#660;|
|Low|33|21| -- | 11&#660;|

Here ~ signifies final glottal constriction.
## Central Merger with D
Pekon, Kayah Li, and Kayaw merge B-prime with D.

## "B-prime" with Voiced Initials
At some point in the evolution of final obstruents, all B-prime items with voiced initials merged with some other category.
Which category that was cannot be known.
\(A less likely possibility: the protolanguage had a phonotactic constraint against the B-prime final obstruent occurring with voiced intials\).

For similar example of development of obstruent-final syllables as conditioned by voicing, see the case of [Biao Min](cf-Biao-Min.md).
