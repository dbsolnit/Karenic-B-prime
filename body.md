# The Proposal
## Peripheral Merger with A or B
Pa-O and Sgaw merge B-prime with A.

Pho merges B-prime with B.

Sgaw Tones \(check\)
| |A | B| B'| D|
--|--|--| --| --|
|High|55|53&#660;|53&#660;| x|
|Mid|55|53&#660;|53&#660;| x|
|Low|33|11| -- | x|
## Central Merger with D
Pekon, Kayah Li, and Kayaw merge B-prime with D.

## "B-prime" with Voiced Initials
At some point in the evolution of final obstruents, all B-prime items with voiced initials merged with some other category.
\(a less likely possibility: the protolanguage had a phonotactic constraint against the B-prime final obstruent occurring with voiced intials\).
Which category that was cannot be known.

For similar example of development of obstruent-final syllables as conditioned by voicing, see the case of [Biao Min](cf-Biao-Min.md).
